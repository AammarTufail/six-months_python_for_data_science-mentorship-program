    "# ANOVA\n",
    "ANOVA is a statistical test that stands for analysis of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. The idea behind ANOVA is to compare different groups of samples to determine whether there is a significant difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is an extension of the t and the z test and was developed to compare more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis of ANOVA is that there is no difference between the groups. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is an omnibus test, meaning it tests the data as a whole. In other words, it does not tell you which specific groups were significantly different from each other; it only tells you that at least two groups were different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of ANOVA:\n",
    "1. One-way ANOVA\n",
    "2. Two-way ANOVA\n",
    "3. N-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "One-way ANOVA is used to compare two or more groups of samples across one continuous independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could use a one-way ANOVA to compare the height of people living in different cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-way ANOVA is used to compare two or more groups of samples across two independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could use a two-way ANOVA to compare the height of people living in different cities and different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "N-way ANOVA is used to compare two or more groups of samples across N independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA has three main assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The samples are independent.\n",
    "2. The samples are normally distributed.\n",
    "3. The variance of each group is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assumptions are not met, you may not be able to trust the results of your ANOVA."

    "3. **Type I and II Errors**: There's often a trade-off between the risk of Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives). More conservative tests (like Bonferroni) reduce the risk of Type I errors but increase the risk of Type II errors.\n",
