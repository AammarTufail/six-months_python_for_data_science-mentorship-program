Tensorboard is a visualization tool provided by Tensorflow to visualize the training process of your model. It is very helpful to visualize the training process, model architecture, and other important details of your model.\n","\n","## **`What is Tensorboard?`**\n","\n","TensorBoard is a suite of visualization tools that makes it easier to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs. It includes a suite of tools for visualizing data flow graphs, profiling, and debugging TensorFlow programs.\n","\n","## **`Why Tensorboard?`**\n","\n","TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:\n","\n","- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy\n","- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)\n","- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time\n","- Projecting embeddings to a lower-dimensional space\n","- Displaying images, text, and audio data\n","- Profiling input data and model structure\n","- Displaying profiled data, such as input pipeline processing time, model execution time, and how long each op takes\n","\n","## **`How to use Tensorboard?`**\n","\n","To use Tensorboard, you need to install Tensorflow and then you can use Tensorboard to visualize the training process of your model. Here is a step by step guide on how to use Tensorboard.\n","\n","to install Tensorflow and tensorboard, you can use the following command.\n","\n","```python\n","!pip install tensorflow\n","!pip intall tensorboard\n","```\n","\n","<h1 style=\"font-family: 'poppins'; font-weight: bold; color: Green;\">üë®‚ÄçüíªAuthor: Dr. Muhammad Aamamr Tufail</h1>\n","\n","[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/AammarTufail) \n","[![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammadaammartufail) \n","[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-muhammad-aammar-tufail-02471213b/)  \n","\n","[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Profile-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/@codanics) \n","[![Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/aammar.tufail) \n","[![TikTok](https://img.shields.io/badge/TikTok-Profile-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=tiktok)](https://www.tiktok.com/@draammar)  \n","\n","[![Twitter/X](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/aammar_tufail) \n","[![Instagram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-Profile-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/aammartufail/) \n","[![Email](https://img.shields.io/badge/Email-Contact%20Me-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=email)](mailto:aammar@codanics.com)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Using TensorBoard for visualizing the training process of a simple neural network for basic rectangular data involves several steps.
